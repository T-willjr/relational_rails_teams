This is a relational rails project for mod 2 by TJ Williams and Paul Leonard.  
Above is a model of our database tables and schema.  Tj worked on the one to one relationship between basketball teams and basketball players, while Paul worked on football teams and players.


CRUD, MVC, and RESTful routing conventions were followed, and all user stories were completed.
